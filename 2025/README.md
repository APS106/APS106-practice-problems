#### Creating JupyterHub Links
https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAPS106%2FAPS106-practice-problems&urlpath=tree%2FAPS106-practice-problems%2F2025%2F{WEEK}%2F{FILENAME}&branch=main

For example, if I want to link to the starter notebook file (week2_practice_problems_starter.ipynb) I would use the following link.
https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAPS106%2FAPS106-practice-problems&urlpath=tree%2FAPS106-practice-problems%2F2025%2Fweek2%2Fweek2_practice_problems_starter.ipynb&branch=main

**Note:** By clicking on these linked, the file in the url and all additional files in that subfolder will be cloned to the student's JupyterHub environment.
